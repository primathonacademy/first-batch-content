=> CSS: Animation vs. Transition

Transition:
    1. Needs a triggering element (:hover, :focus etc.)
    2. Only 2 animation states (start and end)
    3. Used for simpler animations (buttons, dropdown menus and so on)
    4. Easier to create but not so many animation/effect possibilities


Animation @keyframes:
    1. It can be used for endless animations
    2. Can set more than 2 states
    3. No boundaries
    4. Both use CPU acceleration for a much smoother effect.
